# In order to ensure automatically-downloaded security updates are properly
# installed, the system must be rebooted on a regular basis. Care has been
# taken to avoid interrupting any ongoing results collection process and to
# avoid granting system reboot privileges to the application user. The
# configuration in this file implements the following strategy:
#
# 1. A cron task creates a sentinel file once every 24 hours
# 2. The Buildbot worker is configured to respond to the creation of the
#    sentinel file by requesting a "graceful shutdown" from the Buildbot
#    master [1]. (see the "create worker" command in this role's main task
#    file)
# 3. The Buildbot master stops assigning new jobs to the Buildbot worker. Once
#    the worker completes its active jobs, the master instructs it to quit.
# 4. systemd detects that the Buildbot worker process has exited. Prior to
#    re-starting it, invokes a verification script [2]. (see the systemd "unit
#    file" defined by this role)
# 5. The verification script detects the presence of the sentinel file from
#    step 1. It removes that file and triggers system reboot.
#
# In this way, system reboot can be scheduled to occur on a regular basis
# without interrupting results collection and without interfering with the
# failure recovery service provided by systemd.
